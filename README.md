# GameMaster
_By Elodie DUFLAUT_

GameMaster is a tool created specifically for Efrei's Escape Game. 
It's a collection of useful web-based software that game masters can use while hosting a game.
It's mainly composed of a camera system and a web based application with all the necessary
information. All these applications are built to be accessible from a specific computer, so
they might not work if you try to launch them on a different device.


## Main website
The main website has not been implemented yet.

## Camera system
The camera system is implemented, but I currently have "la flemme" to describe it yet.
